# ✊✋✌️ Rock Paper Scissors

This is a simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations curriculum. The game was initially built as a console-only application and later upgraded with a basic web-based UI.

This project was done in **two main phases**:

1. **Console Version** – Built using basic JavaScript functions and played through the browser's developer console.
